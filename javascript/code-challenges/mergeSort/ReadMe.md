### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- it took me 3 hours to solve it 


- Big O 
   - Time <--- O(2)
   - Space <----- O(1)

### Solution  
- Create a function called mergeSort  takes one parameter  as an array. 

- Create two loops , the first loop by inspecting elements inside an array.  

- the second loop to move the larger elements to the right.  

- Inside the second loop we will change the index's values between elements.
