<!-- Description of the challenge -->  
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:  
set  
get  
keys  
hash  
contains  


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a HashTable class that has properties for the value stored in the hash table.   
The class should contain the following methods  
set    
get    
keys    
hash    
contains  

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->  
### Big O  
     set method: in the method we use for loop to iteration on index so the complexity is
      space: o(n)  
      time:o(n)
      
      get method:    in the method we use idetify index in array because we hasd the data and every element 
      has a spacific key to get it so the complexity is
      space: o(1)  
      time:o(1)
      
      contains method:  in the method we use the pervious get method that  identify
      index in array because we hasd the data and every element 
      has a spacific key to get it so the complexity is   
      space: o(1)  
      time:o(1)
      
      keys method: in the method we use for loop to iteration on index so the complexity is
      space: o(n)  
      time:o(n)
